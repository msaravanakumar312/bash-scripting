# QUESTION TAGS:- 
            A question tag is a very short question 'tagged' on at the end of a statement. Which change the statements into question.

# Tricks:
       -> Tag question is usually used auxiliary verb,main verb and subject or pronoun.
       -> When auxiliary verb helping to main verb in a statement, to form a question tag using auxiliary verb only.
       -> If in the sentence model auxiliary verb is there, the question tag has to be formed model verb.


# EX:
    She said half price,doesn't she?

Positive statements always will give negative question tags.
# EX:
---------------------------------------------------
Positive statemets           Question tags
He is excellent in studying,  isn't he?
You were late,                weren't you?
She writes well,              doesn't she?
They have confirmed,          haven't they?
You like cookies,             don't you?
------------------------------------------------


Negative statements always will give question tags
# EX:

Negative statement                 Question tags
He isn't an athlete,               is he?

He isn't a cop,                    is he?

------------------------------------------------------

# Exception:- 
            Exception in the sense there is No auxiliary verb in the statement.

# Forming & using Question Tags in sentence:
# -> Puntuation:
            In sentence with a question as follows- Capital letter to begin the sentence, a Comma at the end of the statement then starts begin with a lower case letter follows by tag question & a question mark.

            The tag is usually an auxiliary verb and a pronoun.

# EX:-
        1. He is intelligent,isn't he?
        2.You're a doctor,aren't you?

# ->Pronoun:-
             A pronoun is used as the subject and the same pronoun used to form the question tags.

# EX:-
        If the given sentence is with (somebody,someone,nobody, noone,anyone, anybody,everyone, everybody, neither, few) we should use "they" (has the subject pronoun) to form a qustion tag.

        1.Someone has come to this room,haven't they? here subject pronoun is they so we need to use haven't.
        2.Somebody can do it,can't they?
        3.Anyone  can attend the party,can't they? -->here anyone is indefinite pronoun so subject pronoun they used.
        4.Anybody will take the chance,won't they? --> will is auxiliary verb so will+not =won't need to use.
        5.Noone ate the apple,Did they? --> here subject pronoun is they so we need to use haven't & ate is 2nd form of simple past tense and no auxiliary verb used hence sholud write 
        id.

        6.Nobody came to the prayer,Did they?
        7.Neither of us run fast,do they?  -->Neither is indefinite verb so we need to write subject pronoun they and ther is no auxiliary verb and there is us is 1st form verb and simple present hence we should write do,does.
        8.Everyone should write the test,shouldn't they?
# Note:-
        If the given sentence is with something, anything, nothing, everything we use "it" (has subject pronoun) to form question tag.

        1.Something is there, isn't it?
        2.Anything will be presented, won't it?
        3.Nothing is right answer,is it?  -->here the word nothing is negative so used positive question tag.
        4.Everything is right answer,isn't it?

# If the statement is positive the question tag should be negative & If the statement is negative the question tag should be positive.

EX:-
    1.You are happy,aren't you?
    2.You aren't happy,are you?

    When a statement express emotions of anger,Surprise,intrest the question tag used  to be positive even though the statement also positive.
# EX:
    1.You think it something to be proud of,do you?

# Note: 
    When there are 2 verb(auxiliary verb/main verb) in a statement,the question form should be using the auxiliary verb.

# EX:
    They were waiting for her,wern't they?

* If the sentence contains a model auxiliary verb, the question tag has to be formed using the model verb.

# EX:
    The student should being their parents for the meeting,shouldn't they?

* Sentence with action verb in the simple present tense form a question tag using the verb "do/does" & it corresponding negative form.

Ex:
    He teaches mathmetics,doesn't he?

* A sentence in the simple past tense will have question tags formed using the verb "did".

EX:
    Harry & Tom played tennis,didn't they?

* As for as imperative sentence are concerned use the positive or negative form of the verb, "will" to form the question tag.

-> Imperative is a sentence that gives command or an order, it will always sound like bossing someone.

Ex:
    1.Open the door,will you?
    2.Please come here,will you?
